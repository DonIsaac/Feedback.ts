#Setup
To use it you need of course JQuery, so make sure it is loaded first. I always like to use JQuery.com CDN for that:
```html
   <script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.11.2.min.js"></script>
```

for create screensnapshot you need html2convas.js , so add it into html file :
```html
   <script src="../src/html2canvas.js"></script>
```
for feedback tool you need add feedback.js ( compiled feedback.ts - typescript) :
```html
  <script src="../src/feedback.js"></script>
  ```
